This is a simple Android application that uses Google Document Scanner to scan CNIC caards and extracting some text from it. 


# Why is this Archived?

This app was built as a quick experiment, and does not have the best architecture design and software engineering practices. There is no intention to improve the quality either. For this reason, the repository has been archived. However, you can still use it as a starting point for your application by creating a fork of this repository. 

# Fork Recommendations

The repository is archived but can be forked to serve as a base for your own application. In that case, I recommend that you first spend some time refactoring the code to have a better architecture, separating highly coupled code and eliminating mixing of models, views, and controllers. The code in its current form 'works' but will be painful to maintain in the long run.
